# Python ABC - Abstract Base Classes

This project demonstrates the use of **Abstract Base Classes (ABCs)** in Python using the `abc` module.

## 📚 Background

Abstract Base Classes provide a way to define interfaces when designing object-oriented programs. An abstract class can define methods that must be implemented in any subclass, serving as a blueprint for derived classes.

Python’s built-in `abc` module makes it easy to define and enforce abstract methods.

## 🎯 Objective

- Create an abstract class `Animal` using the `ABC` module.
- Define an abstract method `sound()` inside the `Animal` class.
- Create two subclasses:
  - `Dog`, which implements `sound()` and returns `"Bark"`.
  - `Cat`, which implements `sound()` and returns `"Meow"`.
